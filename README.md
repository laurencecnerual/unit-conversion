# unit-conversion
In an attempt to experiment with OOP,
I have created an application that can convert a given value from imperial format to metric format (and vice versa),
for a few different common units of measurement, such as temperature, weight, distance, and height.
This is just my initial draft, so I plan to make some updates/additions to this as I go along.

Updates:
I have added two more classes for handling conversions between liquid volumes for small and large units respectively.
I have also added a new abstract class to handle some of the logic common (which involves a conversionConstant)
between many of these classes (including the two new ones).
Lastly, I added some additional error checking, reformatted some of the command line outputs, and added comments throughout.
