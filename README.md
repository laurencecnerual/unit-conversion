# unit-conversion
In an attempt to experiment with OOP,
I have created an application that can convert a given value from imperial format to metric format (and vice versa),
for a few different common units of measurement, such as temperature, weight, distance, and height.
This is just my initial draft, so I plan to make some updates/additions to this as I go along.
